# Social coding with GitHub

Derogatory stereotypes to the contrary, developers are a social breed. In fact,
sharing code is quite an intimate experience, which you could argue makes coders
more sociable than the general public. In this talk, you will learn about
GitHub, a great site for hosting and collaborating on source code stored in Git
repositories. You’ll also learn about Git, a distributed version control system
that’s fast, powerful, and fun! The two together make for some promiscuous code
sharing!
