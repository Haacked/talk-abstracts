# Jazz up your open source project with GitHub

GitHub embodies the concept of "social coding" as a place for developers to host
and collaborate on open source code. But many developers don’t get the full
benefits of GitHub. In this talk, you’ll learn a bit about GitHub the company
and how its philosophy is infused in GitHub products. You’ll also learn to boost
the effectiveness of your open source efforts with lesser known features of
GitHub. I’ll cover:

* GitHub Pages for a great project landing page.
* Navigating GitHub like a pro with Keyboard shortcuts and the new Command Bar
* The GitHub API for more awesomeness.
* And if time, the GitHub client apps.
