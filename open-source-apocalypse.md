# Open Source Apocalypse: Imagining .NET Open Source in Our Hands

There’s a lot of angst in the .NET open source community about the relative lack
of maturity when compared to thriving open source communities such as the Ruby
and Node communities.

Many blame the effects of large corporate influence such as that of a certain a 
very large company in the pacific northwest. The claim is that when the titan 
releases substandard open source projects, it sucks the air from all existing
projects in the same space. Is this true?

Let’s imagine a world in which this company suddenly ceases to exist. Would your 
.NET OSS project still be relevant? Would it survive on its own merits without
a large corporation bolstering .NET?

Perhaps it’s time to put responsibility for the success of our projects in our
own hands and not leave it to chance or the whims of a large corporation.

Come learn some tips on navigating a world where a large corporation is involved
in .NET OSS (hint, it’s been done before) and how to create a project that can 
stand on its own in the presence of an 800lb gorilla.
