# Open Source Apocalypse: Imagining .NET Open Source in a Post Microsoft World

There’s a lot of angst in the .NET open source community about the relative lack
of maturity when compared to thriving open source communities such as the Ruby
and Node communities.

Many blame Microsoft, calling it a destructive force of nature. When the titan

.NET OSS project still be relevant? Would it survive on its own merits without
Microsoft bolstering .NET?

Come learn why we have to stop worrying so much about Microsoft and take matters
into our own hands. Learn some tips on creating a project that is insulated from
the winds of Microsoft and can stand on its own in the presence of the 800lb
gorilla.
