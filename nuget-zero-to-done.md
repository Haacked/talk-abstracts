# NuGet: Zero to DONE in no time.

Developers are known for “scratching their own itch,” producing thousands of
libraries to handle every imaginable task. NuGet is an open source package
manager from the Outercurve Foundation for .NET (and Windows) developers that
brings these libraries together in one gallery and accelerates getting started
with a project. It makes it easy to incorporate these libraries in a solution.

In this talk, Phil Haack, project coordinator for NuGet, will describe the
problem that NuGet solves, how to make effective use of it, and some tips and
tricks around the newer features of NuGet.
